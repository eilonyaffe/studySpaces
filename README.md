# StudySpaces

A Node.js/TypeScript project for managing and serving available classroom spaces in the main campus of BGU.

---

## ‚ú® Features
‚úÖ Scrapes room availability data  
‚úÖ Serves user search queries, filtered by date, time range, and sorted by location (of provided by the user)  
‚úÖ Simple yet functional HTML frontend  

---

## üß† Logic
‚úÖ It is publicly available to view BGU's course schedules on the web  
‚úÖ Performing a "complement" for these schedules (which indicate occupancy) allows us to find available rooms  
‚úÖ If the user provided a location, we sort results by distance from the buildings, by the haversine function

## üöÄ Project Structure
- `data/full/semester_{semester}/processed/`: JSON files for each hour
- `templates/index.html`: frontend for selecting time range, date, and location
- `app.ts`: admin script for scraping (uses `index.ts` and `utils.ts` for auxiliary function)
- `server.ts`: user-facing server for `/search` requests
- `geo_distance.ts`: functions to sort the results using haversine- a function for measuring distances between geo locations
- `config.ts`: booleans and ints that determine the settings of the program
- `static/locations.json`: contains building numbers and locations for buildings relevant to the app
